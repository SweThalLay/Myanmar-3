    <p>Since there is now a new restaurant (again) in Boston, I thought I might write a short essay on the subject - to provide an introduction to a completely different Asian cuisine in an easy to understand manner.I have read a few critiques of the various Burmese restaurants around the country, and noticed that, invariably, Burmese food is compared to Thai or Chinese or Indian or some other nation's cuisine. And I hope that this essay will help place Burmese food into its own context - and its enjoyment assured! My almost hidden intention is to allow the harshest critics of this food a basic understanding of the subject - since here in the USA, we tend to change other peoples cuisines (if not their cultures) to meet our expectations rather than to critique it in its original context. As a Burmese-American foodie, then, here is my contribution to enjoyment of Burmese food.The main thing to keep in mind though is that each dish may have a "classic" Burmese (or Shan, or Kachin, or Kayah, or Mon, or other indigenous) rendition and a plethora of individualized interpretations – just as pizza, tomato pie, cheese pie, etc., have their renditions throughout the USA. To further this point, the classic Burmese "Indian" dish of "sour cooked pork" ("wet-thar achin chet") uses pork and very sour mangoes. The home cook then adjusts to the meat at hand (pork or beef or chicken) and the sour ingredients at hand (ranging from the traditional sour mango to canned indian lime or mango pickles). The Burmese restaurant in Washington DC uses beef.

	<p>Myanmar is celebrating Thingyan, a Buddhist water festival, which sees thousands of people filing the streets to call in the new year. Beginning on 13 April (in the Western calendar), the four-day festival sees people douse each other in water, which symbolises spiritual cleansing in order to begin the new year free from impurities. The water also symbolises fortune and purity that will clear all diseases, sins and bad luck, so it is thought that the wetter you get, the more good luck you will receive in the new year.</p>
